# Lab 2 - Redis Enterprise Cloud setup

Duration: 30 mins

If you are doing this in an in-person event or in a class room setting with a mentor, chances are that the Redis Enterprise Cloud on AWS is already setup for you.
Simply ask for the following Redis Enterprise Cloud database endpoint details.

You need the following details:

```
Redis Enterprise Cloud Database Hostname
Redis Enterprise Cloud Database Port Number
Redis Enterprise Cloud Database Password
```

If you already have the above details for your Redis Enterprise Cloud database, you can proceed to the next lab.

If you are doing this lab exercises by yourself at your home or office and you are not in a webinar or another guided in-person event, you can setup Redis Enterprise Cloud on AWS very easily, by following the instructions given in this resource : [how-to-guide-aws-redis-free-trial](https://github.com/spendyaala/how-to-guide-aws-redis-free-trial)
